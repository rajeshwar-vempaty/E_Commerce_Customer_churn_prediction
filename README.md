# E-Commerce Customer Churn Prediction - Capstone Project

## Introduction
This repository contains the work for the Capstone Project in Data Science and Business Analytics (DSBA, Oct 2020) by Anurag VRS. The project focuses on predicting customer churn for an E-commerce company, a crucial challenge in the current competitive market. The dataset comprises over 11,000 accounts with 19 variables, including account details, customer demographics, revenue, ratings, and more.

## Project Overview
- **Business Problem**: The challenge lies in managing customer churn, especially in E-commerce, where losing one account could mean losing multiple customers.
- **Objective**: To develop a model for churn prediction, enabling the company to target potential churners with specific offers, based on insights derived from the dataset.
- **Methodology**: The approach includes descriptive and exploratory data analysis, visualizing correlations and distributions, and employing various machine learning techniques.
